# This is the repository for all my works. There are several main sections. 

  In section "My websites" you can find all my sites. In this works I generally have trained how to work with HTML, CSS, SCSS, CSS @keyframes, Gulp, BEM, Linters, learned how to connect and customize plugins. However, in the last site all JS code, except slider, was written by me personally.
  
  In section "JS projects" there are my JS projects and homeworks from several cources.
  
  In section "React projects" I have all React apps.
  
  In section "Gulp" I published one of my basic gulp template.

  For comfortable orientation in my projects, you can use this link: https://denys1911.github.io/Portfolio/dist/. This is my portfolio site. In section "works" you can find links on projects and links on their code at Github.
