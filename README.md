# This is the repository for my works.

  For comfortable orientation in my projects, you can use [link](https://dengoloborodko.github.io/Portfolio/Portfolio/dist/) on my
   portfolio site. In section "My works" you can find links on projects and links on their code at Github and also short description of the projects and used technologies.
  
## The repository has several main sections:

- In the section "My websites" you can find all my sites. In this works I generally have trained how to work with HTML, CSS, SCSS, CSS @keyframes, Gulp, BEM, Linters, learned how to connect and customize plugins(for example Mmenu, OwlCarouel2, Fotorama, selectize.js,  fancybox). However, in the last site all JS code, except slider, was written by me.
  
- In the section "JS projects" there are my JS projects and homework from several courses. In this works I was working with DOM, BOM, Fetch, XHR, Promise, async/await, RegExp, modules, constructors, classes, JSON, Date, etc. And also have practiced working with such libraries: moment, jQuery, math.js.
  
- In the section "React projects" I have all React apps. In these projects I've practiced with: JSX, functional and class components, state, setState, events, controllable components, React Lifecycle Methods, Children & Context API, default props, propTypes, Hooks and worked with prop-types & react-router-dom libraries. 
  
- In the section "Gulp" I published one of my basic gulp templates. In this template, I am using such plugins as browser-sync, gulp-sass, gulp-stylelint, gulp-autoprefixer, gulp-concat, gulp-uglify, del, gulp-rename. In my other works I was using gulp-babel with additional babel plugins, and, sometimes, combined webpack with gulp.
