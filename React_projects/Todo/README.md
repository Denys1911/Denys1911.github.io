Todo application
------------------------------
This is my first React app. In this Todo app you can:

  •	Add/delete tasks in your to-do list
  •	Mark tasks as important/completed
  •	Sort tasks by categories “all”, “active” and “done”
  •	Search for tasks by typing a text in search input
  •	You can see the counters of completed/not completed tasks.

In this project I have learned to work with: create-react-app, JSX, props, functional and class components, state, setState, events, controllable components and forms in React.
